@0    = ~But wait! Now I see it clearly - you are a spawn of Bhaal like Yaga-Shura is one. You are the one he and his so-called friends are afraid of. You are the one who can spoil the plan of the Five still.~
@1    = ~They are five no longer, and soon they will be none.~
@2    = ~You know more than you would have us guess at first, is that so?~
@3    = ~Does this mean we may become allies against them?~
@4    = ~My belongings are hidden around these halls. With my weapons back in hand you will find me a dedicated foe of the Five and their allies. I will be beside the one who triumphs. You will not regret to take me along, child of murder.~
@5    = ~My party is full but you can take your chance and find your weapons and meet me at the riverside outside of Saradush.~
@6    = ~Your arguments and your dedication are compelling. Let's go and find your stuff.~
@7    = ~I see no point to take with me one so weak to get captured this way. ~
@8    = ~You are a fool to expect me to wait. I shall return to the North as the sulphur stench of these lands galls me! From there I will hear the tales of your downfall with pleasure. You will fall just like the Five will fall but I will live.~
